- [x] Go to the repository
- [ ] Fork this repository to your github account and import to a new workspace
- [ ] Submit your website using the link on the Agenda

#### Starter Code

- [ ] Read through the HTML starter code to understand the organization and class names given.
- [ ] Read through the `script.js` starter code to determine what global variables are declared, and what the two declared functions do.
- [ ] Go to the API documentation [here](https://lyricsovh.docs.apiary.io/#reference/0/lyrics-of-a-song/search) to see how the API request is set up.

### Day 1 Goal 2: Write a fetch request to the API to return the song lyrics

- [ ] Using the documentation, determine the request URL needed to return the lyrics of your favorite song
- [ ] Write the fetch request that logs the lyrics to your favorite song to the console
- [ ] Update the fetch request so the lyrics display on the screen in the correct div

#### Wrap

- [ ] Push your changes!

## Day 2

### Day 2 Goal 1: Add a click handler so the API request can use inputted data

- [ ] Write a click handler for the "Get Lyrics" button and move your fetch request into the body
- [ ] Declare the variables needed, and save the user's artist name and song title to the variables
- [ ] Use template literals to update the request URL in your fetch request so the user's song lyrics display when the button is clicked.

<!-- ### Day 2 Goal 1: Write the code to display your song titles on the page

- [ ] Create a loop that loops through your song name array and displays your song names in the correct div

### Day 2 Goal 2: Write the code to display the rest of your song information

- [ ] Create loops that loop through your song artists, song lengths, images, and links arrays and display the information in the correct divs.

#### Wrap

- [ ] Push your changes!

## Day 3

### Day 3 Goal 1: Write the code to allow users to add additional songs to your playlist

- [ ] Declare a variable and save the value of the user input with class `song`
- [ ] Use `.push()` to add the value to your song name array.

### Day 3 Goal 2: Write the code to allow users to add additional song information to your playlist

- [ ] Declare additional variables and save the values of each input tag
- [ ] Use `.push()` to add each input value to the correct array

#### Wrap

- [ ] Push your changes!

## Day 4

### Day 4 Goal 1: Refactor your arrays so all your song information is stored in Objects

- [ ] Comment out your arrays
- [ ] Create an Object for each of your songs
- [ ] Inside each Object, add key/value pairs to store the title, artist, song length, image, and link
- [ ] Store all your Objects in one array

#### Wrap

- [ ] Push your changes!

## Day 5

### Day 5 Goal 1: Refactor your loops so all your song information displays correctly on the page

- [ ] Update your click handler so the input values are saved in as values in a new Object
- [ ] Update your `.push()` so the input Object is added to your array of Objects
- [ ] Update your loops based on your new array of Objects

#### Wrap

- [ ] Push your changes!

## Project Extensions:

- [ ] Add in your own CSS to personalize your project
